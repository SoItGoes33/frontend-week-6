This week we're going to work on a virtual portfolio site using jQuery

## Exercise 1 - Nav

1. In the main content div, display only the "home" section initially
2. When clicking on one of the tabs in the nav bar, show the appropriate section of the page and hide all others.
3. Make the current tab highlighted in some way.

Bonus:

1. Use an animated transition when switching to a section of the site
